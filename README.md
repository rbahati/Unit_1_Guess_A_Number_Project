# Unit_1_Guess_A_Number_Project

 **Description:**

 **This project is a number guessing game written in Python. It asks the end user to guess for a number within the range of 1 to 10 and records the number of tries. It also gives statistics on the mean, mode and median of those number of tries**

**Features:**

* Randomly generate a secret number for the user to guess
* Takes the user's input and make a comparison with the randomly generated secret number
* If the user's guess is lower, the program notifies the user accordingly and ask him/her to try again
* If the user's guess is higher, the program notifies the user accordingly and ask him/her to try again
* If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and records the number of tries in a list for statistical reasons. 
* After having guessed the right number, the user has the choice to continue or to end the game. 
* If the user chooses to continue, the user gets the number of tries to beat next.
* If the user chooses to terminate the program, an exit message is presented to him with all the statistics on his saved attempts.

**Usage:**

* To use this program effectively, run the guessing_game.py script
* From the command line on your console, type the command python guessing_game.py to run the script
